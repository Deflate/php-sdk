==========

With our official SDK you can easily enhance your PHP application with our easy to use SDK. 

## Installation

### Composer
If you're using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you can simply add a dependency on `deflate/php-sdk-deprecated` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here's an example of a dependency on version 1.0.0:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "deflate/php-sdk": "^1.0"
    }
}
```

Alternatively you can also execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```
composer require deflate/php-sdk
```

### Using Git
If you already have git setup and want to use Deflate in subdirectory of your current project you can execute the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:deflate/php-sdk.git deflate/
```
